                I currently have two active music projecs, both of which specialize in ambient-adjacent music.<br><br>
                The first one, Serus, started out as a throwaway account. Back in the day, I used to produce EDM under the alias 'Pyrogenix', 
                and Serus was where I posted songs that didn't make the cut for my main page. <br><br>Since then, the Pyrogenix project has fallen inactive,
                and I have repurposed Serus into an ambient / dungeon synth project where I experiment with dark and fantastical sounds. <br><br>The second
                active project, NIGHTDRIVER, takes the opposite approach. Unlike Serus which looks to the past with  its medieval and fantasy influences,
                NIGHTDRIVER looks to the future with dreampunk and house music that captures the feeling of wandering through a neon soaked metropolis at 4AM.
                <br><br>This is just music I produce for fun, and I don't really try to promote it anywhere, but if you are interested
                I have linked both projects below:
