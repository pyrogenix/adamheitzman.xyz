My debut winter synth album "Cold Hands", released this February under the name *Shrouded Hermit* can now be found on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1yBtdpcOxihfVrppF3A2sV), 
[Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cold-hands/1735611953), and all other major streaming services!

Truthfully, it has been on steaming for some time now, and I just neglected to post about it here. 

Additionally, there is still no ETA on when or if there will be any sort of physical release for this album.
