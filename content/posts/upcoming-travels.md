This summer, I will be out of the country for the last week of may and all of June. 
The last week of may, I will spend with my family travelling Ireland, a country which I have not been to before.
Following that, I will leave on my own flight to Gdansk, Poland, where I will spend the month of June working remotely.
After my stay in Gdansk, I may go to Warsaw for a couple days. I also hope to check out Bia≈Çystok when I'm in Poland as well. 

Next, I shall make my way north to Lithuania, and likely spend a few days to a week in Vilnius before finally heading to Riga, where I plan to fly home from in early July. From Riga, I definitely plan to venture out to Sigulda or Cesis for
day trips within Latvia, but I'd also like to head down to Siauliai, Lithuania (which is ironically easier to access from Riga than Vilnius) and
check out the hill of crosses. Of couse, I also plan to visit and attend many local Orthodox churches in these countries whilst I am there.

I'm looking forward to my travels, which, if everything goes right, will hopefully be the first of many remote work adventures to come!
