A little over a week ago, I released a new album under my brand new Winter Synth project *Shrouded Hermit*. It also happens to be the fist time I've ever fully completed and published a full album under any project.

Produced during the summer and autumn of 2023, this album tries to capture the feelings of desolation, cold, and...comfort. Whether you're wandering through a dark forest in the depths of winter, or exploring an abandoned fortress after dark, this album is for lonely hermit who walks the world on his own terms. 

If this sounds interesting to you, you can listen to and purchase it on [Bandcamp](https://shroudedhermit.bandcamp.com/album/cold-hands). Alternatively, you can give it a listen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU2rJ0vvsXo). 

Due to the obscurity of this project, it is not currently available on streaming services nor is there any physical release. Thus, if you would like to support my musical endeavors, a digital purchase would be greatly appreciated!
