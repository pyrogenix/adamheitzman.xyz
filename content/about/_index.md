Hi, I'm Adam Heitzman. I am currently working as a Customer Support agent at Sonoran Software Systems, though I am looking to expand into IT/Systems Administraion in the near future. Aside from computers, I am primarily interested in puer tea and music production, though I also enjoy travelling abroad and the occasional bit of photography. If you share my interests, or would otherwise like to contact me, feel free to shoot an email over to [adam@adamheitzman.xyz](mailto:adam@adamheitzman.xyz).
