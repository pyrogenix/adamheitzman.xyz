<h3>27 April 2024</h3>
My debut winter synth album &ldquo;Cold Hands&rdquo;, released this February under the name Shrouded Hermit can now be found on Spotify, Apple Music, and all other major streaming services!
Truthfully, it has been on steaming for some time now, and I just neglected to post about it here.
Additionally, there is still no ETA on when or if there will be any sort of physical release for this album.

<h3>22 April 2024</h3>
This summer, I will be out of the country for the last week of may and all of June. The last week of may, I will spend with my family travelling Ireland, a country which I have not been to before. Following that, I will leave on my own flight to Gdansk, Poland, and I will spend the month of June working remotely from Europe. After my stay in Gdansk, I may go to Warsaw for a couple days.

<h3>18 February 2024</h3>
A little over a week ago, I released a new album under my brand new Winter Synth project Shrouded Hermit. It also happens to be the fist time I&rsquo;ve ever fully completed and published a full album under any project.
Produced during the summer and autumn of 2023, this album tries to capture the feelings of desolation, cold, and&hellip;comfort. Whether you&rsquo;re wandering through a dark forest in the depths of winter, or exploring an abandoned fortress after dark, this album is for lonely hermit who walks the world on his own terms.
