<h3>22 April 2024</h3>
This summer, I will be out of the country for the last week of may and all of June. The last week of may, I will spend with my family travelling Ireland, a country which I have not been to before. Following that, I will leave on my own flight to Gdansk, Poland, where I will spend the month of June working remotely. After my stay in Gdansk, I may go to Warsaw for a couple days.

<h2><a class="link" href="/posts/my-new-album/">My New Album</a></h2>
<h3>18 February 2024</h3>
A little over a week ago, I released a new album under my brand new Winter Synth project Shrouded Hermit. It also happens to be the fist time I&rsquo;ve ever fully completed and published a full album under any project.
Produced during the summer and autumn of 2023, this album tries to capture the feelings of desolation, cold, and&hellip;comfort. Whether you&rsquo;re wandering through a dark forest in the depths of winter, or exploring an abandoned fortress after dark, this album is for lonely hermit who walks the world on his own terms.

<h2><a class="link" href="/posts/a-quick-update/">A Quick Update</a></h2>
<h3>22 May 2023</h3>
I figured I&rsquo;d make this post just as a quick update on my life and what&rsquo;s been going on. I have recently accepted an offer to work as a Software Support Agent for Sonoran Software Systems in Prescott, I hope I can learn a lot and gain some basic experience in the tech industry so that I can eventually move on to working in systems or software developement.
In other news, I have placed two decent sized tea orders in the last week, one is a big Shincha order from Thes du Japon, and the other is a wide variety of Chinese teas and a new gaiwan from Nannuoshan.
