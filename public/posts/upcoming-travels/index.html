<p>This summer, I will be out of the country for the last week of may and all of June.
The last week of may, I will spend with my family travelling Ireland, a country which I have not been to before.
Following that, I will leave on my own flight to Gdansk, Poland, where I will spend the month of June working remotely.
After my stay in Gdansk, I may go to Warsaw for a couple days. I also hope to check out Bia≈Çystok when I&rsquo;m in Poland as well.</p>
<p>Next, I shall make my way north to Lithuania, and likely spend a few days to a week in Vilnius before finally heading to Riga, where I plan to fly home from in early July. From Riga, I definitely plan to venture out to Sigulda or Cesis for
day trips within Latvia, but I&rsquo;d also like to head down to Siauliai, Lithuania (which is ironically easier to access from Riga than Vilnius) and
check out the hill of crosses. Of couse, I also plan to visit and attend many local Orthodox churches in these countries whilst I am there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to my travels, which, if everything goes right, will hopefully be the first of many remote work adventures to come!</p>
